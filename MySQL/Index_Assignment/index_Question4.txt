4. Discuss scenarios where indexing might not be beneficial or could potentially degrade database performance.
Ans : 
indexing makes columns faster to query by creating pointers to where data is stored within a database. Imagine you want to find a piece of information that is within a large database. 
Any SQL Server table configuration where performance suffers due to excessive, improper, or missing indexes is considered to be poor indexing.
Extra memory is needed for the indexing data structure.

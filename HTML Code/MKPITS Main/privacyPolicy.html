                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
                <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>

                <p>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b class="text-dark">support@mkpits.in.</b></p>
                <p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
                <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>
                <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>
                <p class="text-dark">12. <b class="text-dark">Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p>
